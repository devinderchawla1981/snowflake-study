SNOWFLAKE IS AVAILABLE ON AWS, AZURE, AND GOOGLE IN OVER 20 REGIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE.
Snowflake is uniquely built to be global,  meaning customers get a single and seamless experience regardless of cloud or region.

If you select AWS as cloud provider when you create your account , it does not mean that you can not access GCP or Azure storage.

1)Our Data Cloud was first available on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which remains an integral Snowflake partner with which we have many joint customers.
Initially snowflake account URL was having only account locator as identifier . Currently region and provider has also been added in URL when you login to snowsight.

2)As Snowflake continues to grow, our customer base continues to expand. We’ve answered by making our Data Cloud available on Microsoft to best serve our customers’ needs.

3)In early 2020, we yet again responded to our customers by offering Snowflake on Google, and continue to expand by making Snowflake available in more Google regions.
